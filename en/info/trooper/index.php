                    <h3>What's Trooper?</h3>
                    <p>Trooper is an affiliate programme that allows us to earn extra money, while you just use the affiliate link. You shop through trooper, and the shops pay Trooper and Irie Vibes a percentage of your total order price. You don't pay anything extra!</p>
                    <p>Too much of a hassle? You're in luck! Trooper has built a special TrooperBot. Essentially, this is an extention that will remind you every time you land on a webshop that is affiliated with Trooper. That way, you don't miss out any chances of feeling proud of yourself for supporting us.</p>
