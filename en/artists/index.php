                            <p>Donovan Kingjay is a common name and figure in the London sound system culture, the likes of reggae roast for example, on top of that, he’s had releases on a majority of labels over the past 5 or 6 years. Despite the UK scene being mainly Steppa based, and him being a part of it as well, his second studio album takes us up an other alley, as it is a quality roots reggae record. On top of all the mentioned before, he’s a very talented vocalist, and singer songwriter. His latest album, could well fit in with the greats from Jamaica, “it only gets better when you hear it.” Being a tenor voice, often said to be sounding like Bushman, Dennis Brown, and even Michael Prophet, it’s no wonder he can handle anything, whether roots, nyabinghi or rub-a dub style. As a true rastaman, he preaches spiritual conciousness and ital living, which can easily be heard in many of his songs, for example “Glory to him.” <br/>
                                The Rootz Lions is a roots reggae band formed back in 2016 as a collaboration project between Roots Lions and
                                Carla Jah. In the past, they have worked with artists like Chezidek, Prince Jamo and ofcourse
                                Donovan Kingjay. They will be the backing band for Donovan Kingjay on the festival.

The brothers are great vocalists, each contributing in their very own way, while their dad is an excellent bass player. After their first album gained great succes, they even went on an European tour with none other than Collie Budz.</p>

                            <p>Uwe Banton, is a German reggae singer who can look back on many years of experience in reggae music. Being inspired by the early 80’s, and artists like Peter Tosh, Burning Spear and more, he made his first trip to Jamaicain 1981. Back in Germany, he started dj’ing on riddims like Sleng Teng and others, especially during the early dancehall era. In the 90’s, he joined his first band called “MOVEMENTS”, a cross African, Jamaican and German band. He’s played on almost every major reggae festival in Central Europe, from Summerjam to Reggae Ruhr, and so on. Always spreading messages about peace, love, justice and equal rights.

A little backstory: Earthworks is a collective, studio and band that has been gaining increasingly bigger traction. Their latest weaponry – a freshly pressed 7” single with Rapha Pico – is already being promoted by Jah Shaka, the king of soundsystem, and also a previous artist and guest to Irie Vibes Roots Festival.<br/>
                                Rapha Pico will be welcomed, alongside Bunnington Judah and Majestic B. Together with Ben King they will be presenting a two hour showcase of the biggest and best from Earth Works studio. Home grown & Rootsy!
