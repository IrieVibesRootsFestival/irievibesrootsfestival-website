                            <p>Donovan Kingjay is a common name and figure in the London sound system culture, the likes of reggae roast for example, on top of that, he‚Äôs had releases on a majority of labels over the past 5 or 6 years. Despite the UK scene being mainly Steppa based, and him being a part of it as well, his second studio album takes us up an other alley, as it is a quality roots reggae record. On top of all the mentioned before, he‚Äôs a very talented vocalist, and singer songwriter. His latest album, could well fit in with the greats from Jamaica, ‚Äúit only gets better when you hear it.‚Äù Being a tenor voice, often said to be sounding like Bushman, Dennis Brown, and even Michael Prophet, it‚Äôs no wonder he can handle anything, whether roots, nyabinghi or rub-a dub style. As a true rastaman, he preaches spiritual conciousness and ital living, which can easily be heard in many of his songs, for example ‚ÄúGlory to him.‚Äù <br/>
                                The Rootz Lions is a roots reggae band formed back in 2016 as a collaboration project between Roots Lions and
                                Carla Jah. In the past, they have worked with artists like Chezidek, Prince Jamo and ofcourse
                                Donovan Kingjay. They will be the backing band for Donovan Kingjay on the festival.

After their first album gained great succes, they even went on an European tour with none other than Collie Budz.</p>
